make releasing updates easier. For you, the contributor, this means you
should run `npm run changeset` when you've got your changes ready. For
more details, see this short document on [adding a changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md#i-am-in-a-single-package-repository).
